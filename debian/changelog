gst-plugins-dvswitch (0.1.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Rename source package to upstream's name, which doesn't include a
      gstreamer version.
  * Update watch file for GitHub UI changes.
  * Port to dh:
    - Bump compat level to 9 for multiarch.
  * Drop la file, from binary package. It's an unnecessary result of building
    a shared library with libtool.
